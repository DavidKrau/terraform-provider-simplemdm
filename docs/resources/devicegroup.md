# simplemdm_devicegroup (Resource)

⚠️ **DEPRECATED AND READ-ONLY**: Device Groups have been superseded by Assignment Groups in SimpleMDM.

**IMPORTANT**: This resource is now **READ-ONLY**. Device groups **cannot be created** via the Terraform provider as the SimpleMDM API does not support device group creation. This resource can only be used to:
- Import existing legacy device groups for read-only management
- Manage profile and attribute assignments on existing legacy groups (using deprecated APIs)
- Track state of legacy device groups

**For all new functionality, please use the `simplemdm_assignmentgroup` resource instead.**

## Limitations

- ❌ **Cannot create** new device groups (API endpoint does not exist)
- ❌ **Cannot update** device group names (API endpoint does not exist)
- ❌ **Cannot delete** device groups (API endpoint does not exist - removal only affects Terraform state)
- ⚠️ Profile/attribute assignments use deprecated APIs

## Example Usage

```terraform
# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: This resource is READ-ONLY and cannot create device groups
# Device groups can only be imported if they already exist as legacy groups

# Import an existing legacy device group (READ-ONLY)
# terraform import simplemdm_devicegroup.legacy_group 123456

# Recommended: Use Assignment Groups for new groups
resource "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "modern_group" {
  name        = "Modern Group"
  auto_deploy = true
  profiles    = [123456, 654321]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Required. The name of the device group.

### Optional

- `attributes` (Map of String) Optional. Map of Custom Configuration Profiles and values set for this Device Group
- `clone_from` (String) Optional. Clone configuration from an existing legacy device group. Changing this value forces a new device group to be created.
- `customprofiles` (Set of String) Optional. List of Custom Configuration Profiles assigned to this Device Group
- `profiles` (Set of String) Optional. List of Configuration Profiles assigned to this Device Group

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) ID of a Device Group in SimpleMDM

## Import

Import is the **ONLY** way to use this resource, as device groups cannot be created via the API.

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used to import existing legacy device groups:

```shell
# Import a legacy device group by specifying the numeric identifier
# Note: Only legacy device group IDs from migrated groups are supported
terraform import simplemdm_devicegroup.example 123456
```

**Important**: After importing, this resource provides read-only access to the device group. Name changes and deletion operations are not supported via the API.
