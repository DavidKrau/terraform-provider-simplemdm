# simplemdm_assignmentgroup (Resource)

Assignment Group resource is used to manage group, you can assign App(s), Custom Profile(s), Device(s), Device Group(s) and set addition details regarding Assignemtn Group.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "myfirstgroup" {
  // Group name required
  name = "My group name"

  // Auto deploy true or false, default is true
  auto_deploy = true

  // ⚠️ DEPRECATED: group_type is deprecated by SimpleMDM API
  // May be ignored for accounts using the New Groups Experience
  // Valid values: "standard" or "munki", defaults to standard
  // If this parameter is changed it will destroy/create whole group
  group_type = "standard"

  // ⚠️ DEPRECATED: install_type is deprecated by SimpleMDM API
  // SimpleMDM recommends setting install_type per-app instead of at group level
  // Valid values: "managed", "self_serve", "managed_updates", "default_installs"
  // Only applies to munki-type assignment groups
  install_type = "managed"

  priority           = 10
  app_track_location = true

  // Assignment relationships
  apps                  = [123456]
  profiles              = [123456, 987654]
  groups                = [135431, 654321]
  devices               = [135431, 987654]
  devices_remove_others = false

  // Post-operation commands
  profiles_sync = false
  apps_push     = false
  apps_update   = false
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the Assignment Group.

### Optional

- `app_track_location` (Boolean) Optional. Controls whether the SimpleMDM app tracks device location when installed.
- `apps` (Set of String) Optional. List of Apps assigned to this assignment group
- `apps_push` (Boolean) Optional. Set true if you would like to send push Apps command after assignment group creation or changes. Defaults to false.
- `apps_update` (Boolean) Optional. Set true if you would like to send update Apps command after assignment group creation or changes. Defaults to false.
- `auto_deploy` (Boolean) Optional. Whether the Apps should be automatically pushed to device(s) when they join this Assignment Group. Defaults to true
- `devices` (Set of String) Optional. List of Devices assigned to this Assignment Group
- `devices_remove_others` (Boolean) Optional. When true, devices assigned through Terraform will be removed from other assignment groups before being added to this one.
- `group_type` (String) Optional. Type of assignment group. Must be one of standard (for MDM app/media deployments) or munki for Munki app deployments. Defaults to standard. ⚠️ DEPRECATED: This field is deprecated by the SimpleMDM API and may be ignored for accounts using the New Groups Experience.
- `groups` (Set of String) Optional. List of Device Groups assigned to this Assignment Group
- `install_type` (String) Optional. The install type for munki assignment groups. Must be one of managed, self_serve, managed_updates or default_installs. This setting has no effect for non-munki (standard) assignment groups. Defaults to managed for munki groups. ⚠️ DEPRECATED: The SimpleMDM API recommends setting install_type per-app using the Assign App endpoint instead of at the group level.
- `priority` (Number) Optional. Sets the priority order in which assignment groups are evaluated when devices are part of multiple groups.
- `profiles` (Set of String) Optional. List of Configuration Profiles (both Custom and predefined Profiles) assigned to this assignment group
- `profiles_sync` (Boolean) Optional. Set true if you would like to send Sync Profiles command after Assignment Group creation or changes. Defaults to false.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Timestamp when the assignment group was created.
- `device_count` (Number) Number of devices currently assigned to the assignment group.
- `group_count` (Number) Number of device groups currently assigned to the assignment group.
- `id` (String) ID of the Assignment Group in SimpleMDM
- `updated_at` (String) Timestamp when the assignment group was last updated.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell

terraform import simplemdm_assigntmentgroup.example 123456
```
