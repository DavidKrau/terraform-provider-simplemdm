  Assignment Group resource is used to manage group, you can assign App(s), Profile(s), Custom Profile(s), Custom Declaration(s), Device(s) and set addition details regarding Group. In case you dont want to manage device/app assignments use lifecycle.

# simplemdm_assignmentgroup (Resource)

Assignment Group resource is used to manage group, you can assign App(s), Profile(s), Custom Profile(s), Custom Declaration(s), Device(s) and set addition details regarding Group. In case you dont want to manage device/app assignments use lifecycle.

  // Group name required
  name = "My group name"
  //auto deploy true or false, default is true
  auto_deploy = true
  //group type "standard" or "munki", defaults to standard. If this parameter is changed it will destroy/create whole group
  profiles      = [123456, 987654]
  devices       = [135431, 987654]
  profiles_sync = false
  apps_push     = false
  apps_update   = false
  attributes = {
    "testAttribute" = "attributevalue"
  }
  apps = [{ app_id = 553192, deployment_type = "munki", install_type = "managed" }]
