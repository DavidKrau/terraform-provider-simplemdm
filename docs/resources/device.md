# simplemdm_device (Resource)

Device resource can be used to manage Device. Can be used together with Custom Profile(s), Attribute(s), Assignment Group(s) or Device Group(s) and set addition details regarding Device.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "simplemdm_device" "firstdevice" {
  // Attribute name (required)
  name           = "mydevice"
  devicename     = "OSmydevice"
  devicegroup    = 123456
  profiles       = [456123]
  customprofiles = [456123]
  attributes = {
    "myattribute" = "testvalue"
  }
}
```

```terraform
# Advanced Example - Device with multiple profiles and attributes
resource "simplemdm_attribute" "location" {
  name          = "office_location"
  default_value = "headquarters"
}

resource "simplemdm_devicegroup" "corporate_devices" {
  name = "Corporate Devices"
}

resource "simplemdm_customprofile" "vpn_profile" {
  name         = "Corporate VPN"
  mobileconfig = file("${path.module}/profiles/vpn.mobileconfig")
}

resource "simplemdm_device" "executive_laptop" {
  name       = "CEO MacBook Pro"
  devicename = "ceo-mbp-2024"

  # Assign to device group
  devicegroup = simplemdm_devicegroup.corporate_devices.id

  # Apply custom profiles
  customprofiles = [
    simplemdm_customprofile.vpn_profile.id,
  ]

  # Set custom attributes
  attributes = {
    (simplemdm_attribute.location.name) = "executive_floor"
    "asset_tag"                         = "EXEC-001"
    "owner"                             = "executive_team"
  }
}

output "device_details" {
  description = "Details of the configured device"
  value = {
    id          = simplemdm_device.executive_laptop.id
    name        = simplemdm_device.executive_laptop.name
    devicename  = simplemdm_device.executive_laptop.devicename
    devicegroup = simplemdm_device.executive_laptop.devicegroup
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Required. The SimpleMDM name of the device.

### Optional

- `attributes` (Map of String) Map of custom attribute names to values for this device.
- `customprofiles` (Set of String) Optional. List of Custom Configuration Profiles assigned to this Device
- `devicegroup` (String) The ID of Device Group where device will be assigned. This uses the deprecated device_group parameter.
- `devicename` (String) The hostname that appears on the device itself. Requires supervision. This operation is asynchronous and occurs when the device is online.
- `profiles` (Set of String) Optional. List of Configuration Profiles assigned to this Device
- `static_group_ids` (Set of String) Set of static group IDs to assign the device to. This is the recommended way to assign devices to groups.

### Read-Only

- `details` (Map of String) Full set of attributes returned by the SimpleMDM device record.
- `enrollmenturl` (String) SimpleMDM enrollment URL is generated when new device is created via API.
- `id` (String) The ID of the Device in SimpleMDM

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Device can be imported by specifying the device ID.
terraform import simplemdm_device.example 123456
```
