  Enrollment resource manages SimpleMDM enrollment links. There are two types: One-time enrollments (with a URL) can be used once by a single device and support sending invitations. Account driven enrollments (URL is null) can be used multiple times but do not support invitations. Note: You must specify either device_group_id (for legacy device groups) or assignment_group_id (for modern assignment groups).

# simplemdm_enrollment (Resource)

Enrollment resource manages SimpleMDM enrollment links. There are two types: One-time enrollments (with a URL) can be used once by a single device and support sending invitations. Account driven enrollments (URL is null) can be used multiple times but do not support invitations.

**Note:** You must specify either `device_group_id` (for legacy device groups) or `assignment_group_id` (for modern assignment groups).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Using legacy device groups (deprecated)
resource "simplemdm_enrollment" "legacy" {
  device_group_id    = "1234"
  user_enrollment    = false
  welcome_screen     = true
  authentication     = false
  invitation_contact = "user@example.com"
}
```

```terraform
# Using modern assignment groups (recommended)
resource "simplemdm_enrollment" "modern" {
  assignment_group_id = "5678"
  user_enrollment     = false
  welcome_screen      = true
  authentication      = false
  invitation_contact  = "user@example.com"
}
```

```terraform
# Advanced Example - User enrollment with authentication
resource "simplemdm_assignmentgroup" "byod_devices" {
  name             = "BYOD Devices"
  auto_deploy      = true
  device_families  = ["iPhone", "iPad"]
}

resource "simplemdm_enrollment" "user_enrollment" {
  assignment_group_id = simplemdm_assignmentgroup.byod_devices.id
  user_enrollment     = true
  welcome_screen      = true
  authentication      = true

  # Optional: Send invitation email (only works for one-time enrollments)
  invitation_contact = "byod-users@example.com"
}

output "enrollment_url" {
  description = "URL for users to enroll their devices"
  value       = simplemdm_enrollment.user_enrollment.url
  sensitive   = true
}

output "enrollment_id" {
  description = "Enrollment configuration ID"
  value       = simplemdm_enrollment.user_enrollment.id
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `assignment_group_id` (String) Identifier of the assignment group to associate with this enrollment. For accounts using the New Groups Experience. Either device_group_id or assignment_group_id must be specified.
- `authentication` (Boolean) Requires authentication before enrollment can proceed. This setting cannot be changed after creation and will force a new resource if modified.
- `device_group_id` (String) Identifier of the legacy device group (deprecated). For accounts using the New Groups Experience, use assignment_group_id instead. Either device_group_id or assignment_group_id must be specified.
- `invitation_contact` (String) Email address or phone number to send an enrollment invitation to after creation or when updated. Phone numbers should be prefixed with + for international numbers. Note: This is write-only - the API does not return invitation history, so Terraform cannot detect if invitations were sent outside of Terraform. Only works for one-time enrollments (not account driven).
- `user_enrollment` (Boolean) When true, creates a user enrollment instead of a device enrollment. This setting cannot be changed after creation and will force a new resource if modified.
- `welcome_screen` (Boolean) Controls whether the welcome screen is shown to end users during enrollment. This setting cannot be changed after creation and will force a new resource if modified.

### Read-Only

- `account_driven` (Boolean) True when the enrollment is account driven (URL is null). Account driven enrollments do not support sending invitations.
- `device_id` (String) Identifier of the device that used this enrollment link, when applicable.
- `id` (String) Numeric identifier of the enrollment.
- `url` (String) Enrollment URL returned by SimpleMDM for one-time enrollments. Will be null for account driven enrollments.
