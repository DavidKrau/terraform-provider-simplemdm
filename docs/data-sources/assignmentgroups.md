# simplemdm_assignmentgroups (Data Source)

Fetches the collection of assignment groups from your SimpleMDM account.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# List all assignment groups in your SimpleMDM account
data "simplemdm_assignmentgroups" "all" {}

# Output the first assignment group's name
output "first_group_name" {
  value = length(data.simplemdm_assignmentgroups.all.assignment_groups) > 0 ? data.simplemdm_assignmentgroups.all.assignment_groups[0].name : "No groups found"
}

# Output all assignment group IDs
output "group_ids" {
  value = [for group in data.simplemdm_assignmentgroups.all.assignment_groups : group.id]
}
```

```terraform
# List all assignment groups and filter by type
data "simplemdm_assignmentgroups" "all" {}

# Filter by auto-deploy enabled
output "auto_deploy_groups" {
  value = [for group in data.simplemdm_assignmentgroups.all.assignment_groups : group.name if group.auto_deploy]
}

# Filter by group type
output "standard_groups" {
  value = [for group in data.simplemdm_assignmentgroups.all.assignment_groups : group.name if group.group_type == "standard"]
}

# Get groups sorted by priority
output "groups_by_priority" {
  value = [for group in sort([for g in data.simplemdm_assignmentgroups.all.assignment_groups : {
    name     = g.name
    priority = g.priority
  }], "priority") : group.name]
}
```
