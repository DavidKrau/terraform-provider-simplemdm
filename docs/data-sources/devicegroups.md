# simplemdm_devicegroups (Data Source)

⚠️ **DEPRECATED**: Device Groups have been superseded by Assignment Groups in SimpleMDM. Please use the `simplemdm_assignmentgroups` data source instead.

**Note**: This data source only returns **legacy device groups** that were migrated from the old system. For modern group functionality, use Assignment Groups.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: Use simplemdm_assignmentgroups instead
# This only returns legacy device groups

data "simplemdm_devicegroups" "all_legacy" {
}

output "legacy_group_count" {
  description = "Number of legacy device groups (deprecated)"
  value       = length(data.simplemdm_devicegroups.all_legacy.device_groups)
}

# Recommended: Use Assignment Groups instead
data "simplemdm_assignmentgroups" "all_modern" {
}

output "modern_group_count" {
  description = "Number of assignment groups"
  value       = length(data.simplemdm_assignmentgroups.all_modern.assignment_groups)
}
```
