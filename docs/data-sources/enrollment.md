# simplemdm_enrollment (Data Source)

Enrollment data source retrieves details for an existing SimpleMDM enrollment. One-time enrollments have a URL and can be used once. Account driven enrollments have a null URL and can be used multiple times.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "simplemdm_enrollment" "by_id" {
  id = "1234"
}

output "enrollment_url" {
  value = data.simplemdm_enrollment.by_id.url
}
```

```terraform
# Advanced Example - Query enrollment and use URL in automation
data "simplemdm_enrollment" "onboarding" {
  id = "1234"
}

# Share enrollment URL via output
output "onboarding_details" {
  description = "Enrollment details for new device onboarding"
  value = {
    id                  = data.simplemdm_enrollment.onboarding.id
    url                 = data.simplemdm_enrollment.onboarding.url
    device_group_id     = data.simplemdm_enrollment.onboarding.device_group_id
    assignment_group_id = data.simplemdm_enrollment.onboarding.assignment_group_id
    user_enrollment     = data.simplemdm_enrollment.onboarding.user_enrollment
    welcome_screen      = data.simplemdm_enrollment.onboarding.welcome_screen
    authentication      = data.simplemdm_enrollment.onboarding.authentication
    account_driven      = data.simplemdm_enrollment.onboarding.account_driven
  }
  sensitive = true
}
```
