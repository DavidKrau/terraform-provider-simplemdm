# Terraform Provider for SimpleMDM

# This is beta release please dont use this in your live environment as of now.

The Terraform SimpleMDM provider is a plugin for Terraform that allows for the full lifecycle management of SimpleMDM resources.

Provider was written by David Kraushuber from FREENOW and was open sourced to the comunity.

## Using the Provider

To use a released provider in your Terraform environment,
run [`terraform init`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) and Terraform will automatically install the
provider. To specify a particular provider version when installing released providers, see
the [Terraform documentation on provider versioning](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#version-provider-versions)

## Examples

All the resources and data sources has [one or more examples](./examples) to give you an idea of how to use this
provider to build your own SimpleMDM infrastructure. Provider's official documentation is located in the [here](./docs/) in form of raw markdown files.

## Know issues

- Acceptance Tests are missing completely!
- API current doesnt support Create and Delete for Device Groups
- API currently doesnt support update of "name" attribute for Device Groups 
- Custom Profiles for Assignment group, Device group and Device can no be updated because of API limitation (they are compared only between plan and state from previous plan), aka adding profile via web will not be considered in next apply.
